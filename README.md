# 2021-March-Madness

## Description

This repo is the code I used for my Men's and Women's March Madness Kaggle Competition submissions.

## Files

All files beginning with 'M' are for the Men's tournament and all files beginning with 'W' are for the Women's tournament.


## Next Steps

- update file paths of data
- alter mens data cleaning to keep score diff
- Make new model building and alterations for mens spread contests
- Write mens Prediction Script (to predict both spread and probabilities, figure out how to save a model)
- Play around with Massey ordinals: Remove trank and teamrank, remove ones that didn't exist in 2008-2019, 2021, remove ones that don't rank all teams, remove ones with high correlations (include Trank, Teamrank, and seeds with correlations)
- Add mens money lines and spreads
- alter womens data cleaning to keep score diff
- Make new model building and alterations for womens spread contests
- Write women's prediction script (to predict both spread and probabilities)
- Add womens money lines and spreads
