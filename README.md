# 2021-March-Madness

## Description

This repo is the code I used for my Men's and Women's March Madness Kaggle Competition submissions in 2021.

## Files

All files beginning with 'M' are for the Men's tournament and all files beginning with 'W' are for the Women's tournament.

**Data Cleaning:** These files are where I scaped data from online and joined it to some of the Kaggle data provided. Then I cleaned that data to get it ready to train the prediction models.

**Model Building:** These files are where I trained the prediction models (prediction probabilties and winning margin). I saved the best model to use in the prediction files.

**Predictions:** These files are where I gathered and cleaned data for the 2021 season and then produced predictions for the 2021 NCAA torunaments.

**Alterations:** These files are where I altered the raw prediciton outputs using some market theory (Vegas betting info should be the most accurate predictions) and game theory (person who wins the Kaggle competition has to have a good mix of accurate predictions and risky predictions).

**Tournament Probabilities:** These files are where I calculate the bracket probabilities for each team (e.g. what is the probability Gonzaga reaches the final four).
