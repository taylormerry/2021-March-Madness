# 2021-March-Madness

## Description

This repo is the code I used for my Men's and Women's March Madness Kaggle Competition submissions.

## Files

All files beginning with 'M' are for the Men's tournament and all files beginning with 'W' are for the Women's tournament.


## Ideas for next year

- Create script to calculate my own adjusted efficiencies
- Create script to calculate adjusted stats as well
- Create model to predict 2022 regular season and conference tournament games to avg with tournament model
