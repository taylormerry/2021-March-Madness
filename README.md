# 2021-March-Madness

## Description

This repo is the code I used for my Men's and Women's March Madness Kaggle Competition submissions.

## Files

All files beginning with 'M' are for the Men's tournament and all files beginning with 'W' are for the Women's tournament.


## Next Steps

- Write script to output round probabilities for each team for mens
- Write script to output round probabilities for each team for womens
- Write Prediction Script
- Play around with Massey ordinals: Remove trank and teamrank, remove ones that didn't exist in 2008-2019, 2021, remove ones that don't rank all teams, remove ones with high correlations (include Trank, Teamrank, and seeds with correlations)
- Write women's prediction script
